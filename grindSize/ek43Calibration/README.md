Please see the short paper I wrote regarding this project located in the `build' directory titled quantitative-assessment-of-burr-alignment.pdf.

To run the program you can clone the whole repository if you don't have data already and want to use mine, or just download the python files located here. The callFile.py and grinderAnaylysis.py files are however a bit specific for this project so you'll need to edit those if you want to use your own data. I hope my comments in these two files will get you going in the right direction, however if not email me at frothGoth@protonmail.com. I do plan on improving these files soon to be more general as I have a new Baratza Vario to test. If you want to run this program with your own data edit the 'valuesArray' variable in grinderAnalysis.py to match the path to your own data csv files as well as the 'preOrPost' variable in callFile.py.

Running callFile.py asks you some questions before running grinderAnalysis.py with your input options.
