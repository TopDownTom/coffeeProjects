Please see the PDF writeup for this project located in the `build' directory. 

To run the program you can clone the whole repository if you don't have data already and want to use mine, or just the python files located here. If you want to run this program with your own data edit the 'valuesArray' variable in grinderAnalysis.py to match the path to your own data csv files.
