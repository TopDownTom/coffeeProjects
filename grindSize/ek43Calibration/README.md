Please see the short paper I wrote regarding this projcet located in the `build' directory titled quantitative-assessment-of-burr-alignment.pdf.

To run the program you can clone the whole repository if you don't have data already and want to use mine, or just download the python files located here. If you want to run this program with your own data edit the 'valuesArray' variable in grinderAnalysis.py to match the path to your own data csv files. There are many images so cloning this whole repo could take a few minutes. 

Running callFile.py asks you some questions before running grinderAnalysis.py with your input options.
